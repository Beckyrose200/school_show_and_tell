Hi, weclome to my school show and tell project!

Having started my apprentiship into software development, I have been invited into the school of my old GCSE and A-Level IT teacher to talk to the students about what I do.

This project is a demonstration of my coding abilitys in the 7 months I have been doing Ruby On Rails.

My aim of this school day is to inspire younger students, especially girls that coding is fun, cool and a great career.
